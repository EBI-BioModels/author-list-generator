# INTRO

This repo was created to generate the paragraph of the authorship of scientific manuscripts. 
When the work is contributed by a hundred of individuals and organisations, it's a challenging 
task to combine all of them and create the paragraph having all author names and respectively 
affiliations.

# NOTES
To be sure the following tasks to be done before running the script.
* Sort the Excel file by the authorship order ascending.
* Set the authorship order of the last authors to very high. This will make sure that these 
authors will be always at the very end.
